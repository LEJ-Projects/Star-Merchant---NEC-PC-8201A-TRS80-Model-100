# Star-Merchant---NEC-PC-8201A-TRS80-Model-100
Star Merchant is a game that I wrote over 40 years ago.  It was originally published in the August 1981 issue of Creative Computing.  It reappeared in David Ahl's book, Big Computer Games.    I recently rehosted it to the TRS-80 Model 100 and NEC PC-8201A.    I tweaked a few of the paramters to make it easier to win.  I hope you enjoy it.   Lloyd
